# 🔊 Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project builds a **machine learning model** using **Logistic Regression** to classify sonar signals as either **rocks 🪨** or **mines 💣**, based on how sonar waves reflect off these objects.  

## 🎯 Why This is Important?  
This classification is crucial in **defense and naval applications**, where distinguishing between natural underwater formations (rocks) and potential threats (mines) is essential.  

### 🔍 Mine Detection  
- Helps military and defense systems detect underwater mines, preventing naval threats.  
- 🚢 **Autonomous Navigation:** Assists submarines and underwater drones in navigating safely by identifying obstacles.  
- 🌊 **Marine Exploration:** Useful in underwater research, ensuring safe operations in unknown territories.  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
✅ When **sonar waves hit a metal mine 💣**, they produce a **strong, distinct reflection** because metal is smooth and dense.  
✅ When **sonar waves hit a rock 🪨**, the reflection is **weaker and more scattered** due to its rough and irregular surface.  
✅ By analyzing these reflected signals, a **Logistic Regression model** can learn the patterns and classify new signals correctly.  

## 🛠️ Project Steps  
1. **📊 Collect Data** – The dataset contains sonar signals labeled as **R (Rock 🪨) or M (Mine 💣)**.  
2. **🧹 Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, normalized data, and prepared features for the model.  
3. **🤖 Train a Model** – **Implemented Logistic Regression** to recognize sonar reflection patterns.  
4. **📈 Test & Improve** – Evaluated accuracy and fine-tuned the model for better performance.  
5. **🔍 Make Predictions** – Used the trained **Logistic Regression** model to classify new sonar signals.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used is the **Sonar Dataset**, which contains numerical values representing sonar signal frequencies.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- 🐍 **Python**  
- 📊 **Pandas & NumPy** (for data preprocessing)  
- 🤖 **Scikit-learn** (for Logistic Regression model)  
- 📉 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
